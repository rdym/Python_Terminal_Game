# The Cave V1.0


This is the first working version of the terminal based exploration game I have named <strong><em>The Cave</em></strong>.

<div style="text-align: justify">In this game you will find yourself lost and alone in a dark cave. You must explore the cave to be able to find the items you require to escape the cave.

<div style="text-align: justify">The game is ran from your terminal, where you can navigate the cave by typing in commands.

<div style="text-align: justify">You can find the code for the game at https://github.com/rdym/Python_Terminal_Game

Hope you enjoy.
